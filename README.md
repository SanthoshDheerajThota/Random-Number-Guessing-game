# Random-Number-Guessing-game
This is just a basic version of random number guesser game.When the program is compiled it will generate a random number differnet each time I seeded the srand in CPP with time inorder to do so.This asks the user to enter the first guess and gives the info if the random number is greater than or less than the guess and continues to do so and It will keep a count of the number of guesses and if the guess is correct it will show the number of guesses it took to be successful in guessing the number
